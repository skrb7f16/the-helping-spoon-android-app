    <string name="how_we_work">
        We aim to redistribute surplus food to those who are in need of it .
        If you have excess food from an event, party, wedding, etc,
        please call our helpline, volunteers .they will collect the excess
        food from you and distribute aiming people who need it .
        The excess food will be checked for quality because lack of proper refrigeration and
        storage tends to spoil food. Here not only the giving part is done also you can take
        food for the needy persons around you and help them .</string>
